# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- none

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

# Run Python files, DeployResources.py when trigger is set from none to master
# Run ResizeVM.py manually as needed
jobs:
  - job: DeployResources
    steps:
      - task: PythonScript@0
        inputs:
          scriptSource: 'filePath'
          scriptPath: CreateResourcesPipeline.py
  - job: ResizeVM
    condition: eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'Manual')
    steps:
      - task: PythonScript@0
